# CognitiveLoadwithGaze
Cognitive load, the mental effort exerted during tasksâ€”plays a crucial role in driving performance and human-computer interaction. This paper demonstrates an efficient approach to estimate cognitive load using eye-tracking metrics, framed from both cognitive psychology and machine learning perspectives. Using the CL-Drive driving dataset of 21 participants with subjective cognitive load ratings, we extract 38 gaze features (pupillary response, blink dynamics, fixations, and saccades) and evaluate several advanced machine learning models for binary (low vs. high) and ternary (low, medium, high) cognitive load classification. We rigorously compare preprocessing methods (no normalization, z-score, baseline correction, and their combination) and find that z-score normalization best balances inter- and intra-subject variability, significantly improving classification accuracy. An iterative feature selection procedure combining random forest importance and statistical tests yields a compact set of four highly informative features (\textit{Fixation Count, Fixation Duration Min, Pupil Diameter Mean, Saccade Duration Min}), maintaining robust model performance while enhancing interpretability.
